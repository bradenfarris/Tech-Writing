# Tech-Writing

Before writing a paper, I will gather all of my sources that are needed or required. I will then read my sources and highlight any information that is applicable to the topic of the paper.

## Choosing Mainpoints

With sources chosen, I will then semi-outline my points and match my information from sources with main pargraph points.

## Writing the Paper 

With my outline of topics and information, I will then *write the paper*. This process **can take hours**. 
-This can be fun
-And not fun, depends on the topic
